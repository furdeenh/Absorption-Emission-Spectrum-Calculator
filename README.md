Emission and Absorption Spectrum Visualization

Author

This project was developed by Furdeen Hasan.

This Python program is designed to help students at the University of Delaware, particularly those enrolled in CHEM 106, better understand emission and absorption spectra. The script calculates the energy change when an electron transitions between energy levels and visually represents the transition using Turtle graphics.

Features

Calculates Energy Change: Determines whether energy is emitted or absorbed based on user-inputted energy levels.

Visual Representation: Uses Turtle graphics to depict electron transitions.

User Interaction: Accepts user input for initial and final energy levels.

Installation

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required libraries:

pip install matplotlib numpy

Usage

Run the script in a Python environment:

python emission_spectra.py

How it Works

The user inputs the initial (i) and final (f) energy levels.

The program calculates the energy difference using:



It prints the energy change value (in Joules).

The program determines whether energy is emitted (if i > f) or absorbed (if f > i).

A visual representation of the transition is drawn using Turtle graphics.

Example Output

Enter i energy level: 3
Enter f energy level: 2
-3.027E-19
Energy emitted

(Visual transition is displayed)

Future Improvements

Implement Matplotlib for spectrum visualization.

Add GUI interface for better user experience.

Expand functionality to include different elements.
